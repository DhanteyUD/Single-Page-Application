## A Quick Test-Drive

To give the completed code a quick test-drive:

1. Install Node.js


3. Navigate to the project folder and run the following from `terminal`:


```js
npm init -y (to create a Node.js project)
npm i express (to install Express)
node server.js (to run the server)
```

Open localhost in a web browser, using the port specified in server.js e.g. http://localhost:3001/
